          <h2>Pen: CSS Glitched Text</h2>
          <h3>by Lucas Bebber</h3>
          <p>In this pen the author, Lucas Bebber, has created a very simplistic looking, but complex effect. Because I am only in the beginning steps of HTML and CSS journey this pen really made me scratch my head as to how it was made. While I am only just starting out I think the author was able to achieve this by having his .glitch start in one spot, then he created .glitch:before and .glitch:after which I think is responsible for the rapid movement to make it look like an actual... well glitch.</p>
